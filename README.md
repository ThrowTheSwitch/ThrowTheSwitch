# ThrowTheSwitch.org

Welcome to the ThrowTheSwitch family of Open Source projects. As a community we build tools 
for building robust software. It all started with a unit test framework for embedded systems
written in C. From there, it's grown to mocking, build and test management, and more. Our 
community is a diverse mix of people working on tiny embedded systems, to Arduino projects, to
large systems projects. Our tools have been used to build robust systems in high reliability
industries, like medical, automotive, and aerospace. We're very proud of what we've built,
while we recognize there is still a lot to do.

Please feel free to explore our repositories here, as well as the community website
